# To-Do or Not-To-Do? That's the question.

"To-Do or Not-To-Do" is a project that aims at refreshing my Scala and general software development skills by building a simple task tracker application, initially as a CLI App and later as a GUI App. Using Scalaâ€™s functional programming features to manage state immutability and ensure a clean codebase.

- Features:
    - The user can create, update, and remove accounts.
    - Users can create, update, remove lists to group their tasks.
    - Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
    - The app provides task prioritization, due dates, reminders, tags, and status tracking.
    - The app offers search based on titles, tags, dates, and data within the tasks.
    - The app offers groups, where users can share lists and tasks.
